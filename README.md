# Job Sphere

## Overview

**Job Sphere** is a comprehensive job marketplace platform, empowering users to discover, apply for, and manage jobs through a feature-rich, location-aware, and analytics-driven experience. Built with Django, Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, and PostGIS, Job Sphere delivers scalable, modular APIs covering authentication, job search, profile management, messaging, notifications, analytics, and more.

## Key Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Robust user login, registration, password resets, JWT authentication with refresh, and logout features.
- **Location-Based Job Discovery**: Real-time map displays, proximity-based job listings, and regional job searches utilizing geospatial data.
- **Comprehensive Profile Management**: User profiles with bios, work experience, contact info, and avatars.
- **Job Posting & Applications**: Post, update, delete, and manage job openings. Allow candidates to apply and track their applications.
- **Activity Monitoring**: Dashboard for tracking job postings, applications, in-progress and completed work.
- **Messaging System**: User-to-user conversations, notifications for new messages, and management of conversations.
- **Advanced Searching & Filtering**: Full-text and filter-driven job discovery with intelligent suggestion features.
- **Role-Based Navigation & Menus**: Dynamic navigation and menu badges tailored to user roles and activities.
- **Media Management**: Efficient upload and deletion of documents and images.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Insights into user engagement, job posting performance, and response statistics.
- **Enterprise Security**: HTTPS enforcement, strict permissions, JWT token rotation, rate limiting on sensitive endpoints.
- **Performance Optimization**: Advanced database indexing, caching of frequent queries (Redis), and asynchronous tasks for notifications and analytics.

## Project Structure

The backend is organized into modular Django apps, each handling a major featureset:

- **authentication**: User accounts and security.
- **map**: Location services and region-based features.
- **profile**: User data and stats.
- **jobs**: Job postings and applications.
- **activity**: User engagement and history.
- **messaging**: Chat system and notifications.
- **search**: Search, filters, and job suggestions.
- **navigation**: Role-based menus and navigation items.
- **media**: File upload and management.
- **analytics**: Analytics insights (optional/enterprise-ready).

Directory layout:
```

  ├── profile/
  ├── jobs/
  ├── activity/
  ├── messaging/
  ├── search/
  ├── navigation/
  ├── media/
  └── analytics/
```
Each app is fully encapsulated with its models, serializers, views, and URLs.


## Architecture Overview

**Job Sphere** features a modular, maintainable backend with:

- **Django**: Rapid and structured development with clean separation per app.
- **Django REST Framework**: Powerful REST APIs plus serializers and permissions.
- **PostgreSQL + PostGIS**: Reliable relational datastore with geospatial extensions.
- **Redis**: Fast caching for high-traffic data.
- **Asynchronous Tasking (Celery, etc.)**: Background processing for emails and analytics.

Main directory structure:
```
Project/
  ├── Project/              # Django settings, WSGI, root URLs
  ├── apps/                 # Apps by module
  ├── manage.py
  └── requirements.txt
```
This modularity ensures scalability and clarity in codebase maintenance.

### Key Optimizations

- Database indexes for all foreign keys, status fields, and search columns.
- Redis caching for repeated-fetch APIs like jobs, searches, and navigation.
- Pagination and dynamic filtering for efficient data delivery.
- Asynchronous background tasks for emails and aggregation.
- Strong adherence to security and operational best practices.

## Database Design

### Entity-Relationship Overview

Major entities and relationships:
- **Users:** Base accounts with credentials and status.
- **Profiles:** Extended details (bio, contact info, etc.)
- **Jobs:** Job postings linked to users with geolocation.
- **Applications:** Job applications connecting users and job postings.
- **Conversations/Messages:** User interactions and history.
- **Notifications:** Activity and message alerts.
- **Regions/Locations:** Area-based filtering and map display.

### Relationships

- 1:1 **Users ↔ Profiles**
- 1:M **Users ↔ Jobs**
- 1:M **Jobs ↔ Applications**
- 1:M **Users ↔ Applications**
- 1:M **Conversations ↔ Messages**
- 1:M **Users ↔ Notifications**

### Performance & Indexing

- B-Tree indexing on all foreign keys and frequently filtered fields.
- GIN/full-text on JSONB/text data.
- PostGIS spatial indexing for all location-based queries.

## Deployment Notes

- Designed for stateless, scalable, dockerized deployment.
- Uses modern Django and environment variable management for configs.
- Flexible for integration with CI/CD, monitoring, and cloud platforms.

### For Developers

- See `requirements.txt` for dependencies.
- Each module app is self-contained for easy contribution/onboarding.
- Configuration managed through centralized and per-app settings.
